# Summer of 2019

In 2019, I was looking for a book similar to cracking the coding interview but for machine learning. I couldn't find one. Blogs have been written on it. I found some resources on github in chinese. My preparation was way scattered. So I decided to learn system design. My preparation mainly focused towards software interviews. 
Till 2019, I had not designed any ML centric systems. I had put models in production with the help of engineering teams but I wasnt the one who designed and build whole system. 
machine learning interviews were different in different companies. I had given google ML interview. I could not clear system design interview. Thats when I started studying system design. I came from data science background. I found system design bit hard as I was not able to accept that its something I should learn. It took me time to grasp the fundamentals. 
Then somehow I got the opportunity to work on big scale systems and have had the opportunity to learn the craft. Designing the systems over and over again, I learned a lot. 
Back then data science were not expected to put models into production and mostly relied on engineering teams. Over the period of time, ML tooling has evolved. Now data scientists are expected to put models into production. That's the reason ML system design has become an improtant skill. 

While ML system design draws heavily from software system design, there are some subtle differences. The differences which will tell interviewer that you are not ML engineer but a software engineer. I believe its better to learn from someone who had been ML engineer and has designed ML systems, not from a software engineer who studied software systems.
There is a good book written by chip huen on ml system design. I have read it and its a good book. I have tried to keep this book different from that book. I have tried to keep this book more practical and less theoretical. I have tried to keep this book more focused on interviews. So we will conduct mock interviews and try to solve problems. So there will be some questions which will try to test your knowledge of Machine learning. Remember, its ML system design not software system design. 

Just remember that there is no right or wrong answer. There are multiple ways to solve a problem. We will try to solve problems in multiple ways. Do not try to design perfect system because there is no perfect system. 

Most of the case studies were actual interview questions. 

- Design a system to predict if transaction is fraud or not.
- Design a system to predict if the user will churn or not.
- Design a system to predict if the user will click on the ad or not.
- Design a system to predict if the user will buy the product or not.
- Design a system to predict if the user will like the movie or not.
- Design a system to predict if the user will like the song or not.
- Design a system to predict if the user will default on loan or not.
- Design a system to predict if the user will default on credit card or not.

If I go by reviews from my managers, ML system design is my strongest suits.
